#Knuckles MVC

##A learning tool, not a Framework

Knuckles MVC is not another JS Framework, its just a tool im using to learn how these frameworks... well.. work. I'll be documenting each component, and I guess someone out there might benefit from it. Ill also be trying to keep it as simple as possible, implementing only the core ideas of MVC.

**This is early stages yet**. Code nowhere near useful in any real world scenario. You'll see what I mean in the source.

###Todo's

- Comment out the extender
- Create events system
- Collection -> Model relationships



###Credit where credits due

Alot of the work is based off frameworks like Backbone, Ember and Knockout. Huge props to the creators and contributors.
