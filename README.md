##A learning tool, not a Framework

Knuckles.js is not another JS Framework, its just a tool im using to learn how these frameworks... well.. work. I'll be documenting each component, and I guess someone out there might benefit from it. Ill also be trying to keep it as simple as possible, implementing only the core ideas of MVC.

**This is early stages yet**. Code nowhere near useful in any real world scenario. You'll see what I mean in the source.



## Changelog

**March 5th 2013**

- Added really, really basic event system using jQuery's "On" method. Baby steps.
- Built Relationship similar to Backbone between Models and Collections.
- Collections Fetch Method gets JSON Data from resource and Creates Models.
